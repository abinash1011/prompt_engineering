            "The ratio of the intensity when the two waves arrive in phase to that when they arrive 90 degrees out phase is: option 1 is to 1, option 2 is to 1, option 3 is to 2, option 4 is to 1. Given the 2 waves have same amplitude and frequency, this implies that they have the same maximum intensities. Therefore, I equals Imax cos 2 phi divided by 2 where phi equals phase difference and I equals intensity at a point. When in phase, I1 equals Imax cos 2(0/2) equals Imax. When 90 degrees out, I2 equals Imax cos 2(pi/4) equals Imax 2 of phase. Therefore, I1 to I2 equals 2 to 1.\n"
